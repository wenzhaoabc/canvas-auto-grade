Grade out of {maxPoints} points. This assignment employs error-tolerant scoring. The maximum grade is attainable by avoiding logical inconsistencies, with execution efficiency and code style being secondary considerations. If the code correctly establishes a linear model, full marks should be awarded. Grading should be lenientâ€”no requirements for comments, parameter explanations, or similar documentation. Points will only be deducted for implementation errors.
